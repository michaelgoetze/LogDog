## Usage

LogDog is an open-source Chrome extension that will keep track of your games on [Dominion.Games](https://dominion.games/). Everytime you play a game of Dominion, LogDog will constantly keep track of the Log for you and store it locally in Chrome (the logs are not synched between computers!).

Now you can come back to your logs anytime in a manner of seconds and save them on your computer to do some fancy analysis yourself or copy them for use in other apps like [Windominion.com](https://windominion.com).

Just click on the LogDog logo next to your adress bar on the right to get access to all your stored logs.
